# Herdr Space Folders

Herdr's spaces list with folders: colored, foldable folders above the loose spaces, filled by dragging or by rules on the folder a space works in, kept in a file in the home of the machine the spaces run on.

## What you see

- **The Spaces header**, 31px: "Spaces" in `dim` 11.5px, then a folder-plus button and Herdr's + (a new space), each 26px.
- **Per machine** (a header per machine once another one is known, as in Herdr's list; each header gets a folder-plus next to its +): the machine's folders in their order, each followed by its spaces when unfolded, then the spaces in no folder.
- **A folder's row**, 30px like a space's: an 18px tile with 5px corners in the folder's color (one of the space avatars' six, `#22a99a #e3814f #5b8def #8b7cf6 #3fae6a #d9649a`, or `dim` grey) holding a white 13px folder icon, the name in `foreground` medium weight, a status glyph when folded and an agent in it is blocked or done, a `dim` "+", the count, and a chevron (down open, right folded).
- **Spaces in a folder** are Herdr's space rows indented to 26px; worktrees stay under their checkout.
- **A machine in a folder** (a folder on this computer whose rules take it in): the machine's header, indented to 26px like the folder's spaces, then its folders and spaces at 26px. It no longer has a group of its own below, and once every other machine is in a folder the "This computer" header goes too. The folder's count and folded status include the machine's spaces.
- **While dragging**: a space over a folder gives the folder an `accent` border on `selected`; a dragged folder goes half transparent and a 2px `accent` line shows where it lands; a space dragged out of a folder shows a dashed drop zone under the list, "Drop here to take it out of its folder".
- **A folder's menu** (right-click), 210 by 160: seven 20px color dots (the current one ringed in `foreground`), "New space here", "Edit folder…", "Delete folder".
- **Edit folder**, a 460px dialog: Name; "Start new spaces in" with "Choose…" on this computer; "Collect spaces from" with a hint; Cancel and Save.

## How it behaves

- Click a folder to fold or unfold it. Press on a space and release on a folder to file it there; on another space to move it to that place (`space.move`) and into that space's folder; anywhere else in the list to take it out of its folder. Press on a folder and release on another to reorder: down puts it after, up before. Only within a machine.
- `alt-down` / `alt-up` (and `ctrl-shift-pagedown` / `pageup`, `ctrl-space shift-n` / `shift-p`) show the space below or above the one in front, in the order the list draws them: through each folder and the machines in it, then the loose spaces, then the next machine. Spaces in a folded folder or machine are skipped; past the last space it goes round to the first. When the space in front is folded away, it steps from where that space would be.
- When the space in front closes, the space shown above it in the list comes in front (the one below when it was at the top), instead of the one Herdr picks by its own order. Spaces in folded folders are skipped.
- A space's folder: the one it was dragged into; "" (dragged out) keeps it out; otherwise the folder whose rules match deepest into the folder its first terminal works in (`~/code/client` beats `~/code`; on a tie the first folder wins). A worktree goes with its checkout's space.
- A machine goes in the first folder on this computer whose rules match its name or the folder one of its spaces works in; a rule like `vm-*` matches a name the way it matches a folder name.
- Rules, comma-separated, each take a folder and everything in it: starting with `/` or `~` they're paths (`~` any home: `/home/x`, `/Users/x`, `/root`), otherwise a folder name at any depth; `*` is any one folder name.
- A folder's + and "New space here" run `space.new` with the start folder (`~` made the machine's `$HOME`) and the machine; the first space that then appears on that machine goes in the folder (Herdr returns no id).
- A space made any other way (Herdr's `space.new` keys, the palette, a script) that comes up in front within 3 seconds goes right under the space in front before it, when it's on the same machine and the only new space then: in the folder that space showed in, and after it in Herdr's order (`space.move`), which the list keeps inside a folder. Spaces of a machine coming in don't count. The list's own + and a machine's + (or "New space there") make one in no folder: the first new space after them is left alone.
- Choosing a start folder while the rules are empty (or the same as it) sets the rules to it too.
- While a folder's name is still "New folder" (or empty, or the start folder's last part), it follows the start folder's last part, typed or chosen: `~/Projects/herdr/` names it `herdr`. Typing a name of its own stops that.
- Every change is shown at once (shared `space-folders`, per machine, `""` for this computer) and written to `~/.config/herdr-space-folders.json` on that machine (`exec sh` with `on`, through a temp file). Every 15 seconds each connected machine's file is read again; a file whose `at` is newer than what's shown wins.

## Built from

- **Mod** `mods/space-folders/`: `mod.clone` of Herdr's `spaces` (0.1.10), so its git, worktree, machine and drag-to-reorder code is Herdr's. Added: folders in `grouped` (`foldered`, `folderHead`), the drop and reorder handlers, the menu (overlay props `folderMenu, machine`) and the edit dialog (overlay props `edit, machine, fresh`) as modes of the same mod.
- **Layout** `layouts/main-folders.json`: Herdr's `main` 0.1.10 with the `spaces` block's mod set to `space-folders`.
- **Keys** `keys.json`: a `layout:main-folders` section binding Herdr's next/previous space keys to `space-folders.next` and `space-folders.prev`. Drawing the list fills the spaces' order (shown or folded away) as it goes; the mod's `nextCommand()` loop steps through it and runs `space.select {id}`.
- **herdr**: `spaces`, `panes`, `machines`, `run` (`space.new`, `space.move`, `space.select`), `openOverlay`, `closeOverlay`, `props`, `shared` / `setShared` (`space-folders`, `space-folders.new`), `exec` (with `on`), `pickFolder`, `home`, `nextCommand`.
- **Icons**: Herdr's own, from `mods/workspace-chrome/` (folder, folder-plus, chevrons, plus).

## Watch out

- There's no drag and drop between elements in mods: it's press on one, release on another, as Herdr's own tabs and spaces do.
- Herdr doesn't reload a mod from a symlinked folder when a file changes; recreating the link (or a restart) does.
- An overlay opened while its mod reloads can come up late or not at all.
- Space ids are per machine: remote spaces show as `machine/id` here and are stored by their own id in that machine's file.
- Herdr's right-click menu on a space can't be extended without cloning it, so there's no "Move to folder" there: drag instead.
- Herdr's own `space.next` and `space.prev` go by the order it keeps the spaces in, which folders don't change, so they jump around the list: the keys have to name the mod's commands instead. Those reach only a copy that shows, so with the sidebar hidden (`ctrl-shift-b`) they do nothing. The section is per layout: a layout of another name needs its own `layout:<name>` section.

## Done when

- `herdr-app check ~/.config/herdr-app/mods/space-folders` passes.
- The folder-plus button opens Edit folder for a new folder, which is made only on Save; Cancel leaves nothing behind.
- Dragging a space onto a folder files it; dragging it out puts it back; dragging a folder reorders the folders.
- A folder with a start folder opens its new spaces there, in the folder.
- Closing the space in front (`space.close`) shows the space above it in the list.
- `herdr-app do space.new` while a space in a folder is in front puts the new space right under it, in that folder; the list's + puts it in none.
- A rule such as `herdr-*` collects the spaces working in matching folders.
- `herdr-app do space-folders.next` from the last space of a folder shows the first space of the next folder, and from the last space in the list the first one.
- `~/.config/herdr-space-folders.json` changes with every edit, and another Herdr on the same machine shows the same folders.
